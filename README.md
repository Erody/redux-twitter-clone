**TODO**

- start developing (rewatch the redux tutorial by wes bos and develop this app alongside)
- how the state is gonna look: 
    - statuses
        - name
        - username
        - text
        - imageUrl
        - tweetId (passed down to replies)
        
    - replies
        - name
        - text
        - imageUrl
        - username
        
    maybe just make replies part of statuses.
